## Description

Given existing code to a website for an example business called Horiseon, I have made that code more accessible with a number of small changes. This helps Horiseon's client base become broader and potentially more diverse to those who require screen readers and other accessibility tools. In providing a more semantic and logical approach in structuring both the html and css files, as well as appending alt text to each image, Horiseon will now be able to cater to a larger audience. The added favicon is an extra touch that helps clients remember Horiseon and their services. If Horiseon needs to make a change after my edits have been implemented, they can easily found the correct section with the comments located throughout the html and css files.

Below are screenshots of the Horiseon webpage. Visually, it will look very similar, but additional accessible measures have been integrated.
